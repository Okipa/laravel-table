## [4.0.7](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/compare/4.0.6...4.0.7)

* Added ability to set a timezone when formatting a date/time column with the `dateTimeFormat` method:
    * Updated column `dateTimeFormat` method signature to `dateTimeFormat(string $dateTimeFormat, string $timezone = null): \Okipa\LaravelTable\Column`

## [4.0.5](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/compare/4.0.4...4.0.5)

2022-03-01

* Fixed error when appending array data to table with the `appendData` method

2021-08-17

* Added `$type` property to `src/Console/Commands/MakeTable` in order to display correct messages:

2021-04-11

## [4.0.2](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/compare/4.0.1...4.0.2)

2021-01-10

* Fixed #66 : Bugfix to allow the `->rowsConditionalClasses()` method to be called several times on a table. In addition, the second `$rowClasses` argument of this method now accepts array or closure (which let you manipulate a `\Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model $model` attribute)
* Fixed #68 : Removed useless treatment when data is appended to paginator with `->appendData()` method, which led to `+` character addition when values were containing spaces

## [4.0.1](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/compare/4.0.0...4.0.1)

2020-09-14

* Fixed wrong `okipa/laravel-html-helper` version in composer.json

:point_right: [See the upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade-guides/from-v3-to-v4.md)

## [3.1.3](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/compare/3.1.2...3.1.3)

2020-09-10

* Fixed wrong sensitive case searching which was involuntarily executed for JSON database fields instead of insensitive case searching as normal

## [3.1.2](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/compare/3.1.1...3.1.2)

2020-08-24

* Fixed doc js snippet given in [destroyConfirmationHtmlAttributes](./README.md#table-destroyConfirmationHtmlAttributes)

## [3.1.1](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/compare/3.1.0...3.1.1)

2020-08-24

* Fixed column cell value not escaped when using `$column->value()` method (https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/issues/54)

## [3.1.0](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/compare/3.0.1...3.1.0)

2020-08-24

* Reverted the previous change (3.0.1) as the `button` method without arguments has no visual effect: added instructions in V2 to v3 the upgrade-guide to take care of this new behaviour
* Fixed an issue where create action button was not displayed when searching and rows number definition were disabled
* Fixed a v3 regression where `rows number definition` was wrongly named `rows number selection` at different places (config, templates, methods, ...): this is an unfortunately breaking change if you published config or templates but I take advantage of the early release of the V3 and from the fact that Laravel 8 is not released to do it
* Show and edit actions are now triggered by a simple link rather than a form, which was useless as these routes are called with a `GET` http request
* Minor default templates changes in order to give laravel-table a prettier look
* Minor default config value changes in order to give laravel-table a prettier look

## [3.0.1](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/compare/3.0.1...3.0.1)

* Fixed Column `button` method behaviour which is supposed to allow usage without arguments

2020-08-09

* Added Laravel 8 support
* Dropped Laravel 6 support

  * `rowsSearchingTemplate`

* Updated templates

:point_right: [See the upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade-guides/from-v2-to-v3.md)

## [1.5.0](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/compare/1.4.0...1.5.0)

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/compare/1.3.0...1.4.0)

2020-04-26

* Added more granularity in the template customization possibilities : the `show`, `edit` and `destroy` actions are now defined in their own component. This way, it becomes easier to customize tiny parts of the table without touching to the others
  * Added `config('laravel-table.template.show')`, `config('laravel-table.template.edit')` and `config('laravel-table.template.destroy')` configs to set each new default component path
  * Added `->showTemplate()`, `->editTemplate()` and `->destroyTemplate()` to give the ability to customize these templates on the fly
* Added fallback path for each template if the config value is not defined, in order to prevent any update breaking change

## [1.3.0](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/compare/1.2.7...1.3.0)

2020-04-25

* Tests have been migrated from Travis to Github actions

## [1.2.6](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/compare/1.2.5...1.2.6)

2020-01-05

* Replaced hard-coded `info` action icon by config value

## [1.2.5](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/compare/1.2.4...1.2.5)

2019-10-15

* Changed the command to publish the configuration to: `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-table:config`
* Changed the command to publish the views to: `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-table:views`
* Improved testing with Travis CI (added some tests with `--prefer-lowest` composer tag to check the package compatibility with the lowest dependencies versions)

## [1.2.4](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/compare/1.2.3...1.2.4)

2019-10-09

* Transferred PhpUnit builds tasks from Scrutinizer to Travis CI
* Transferred code coverage storage from Scrutinizer to Coveralls
* Re-authorized PHP7.1 as minimal version

## [1.2.3](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/compare/1.2.2...1.2.3)

2019-09-13

* The model is now directly passed to the route during the table `show`, `edit` and `destroy` routes generation instead of its id
```php
// Assuming your declared your edit route like this:
(new Table())->model(User::class)->routes([
    // ...
    'edit'    => ['name'=> 'user.edit', 'params' => ['foo' => 'bar']],
    //...
]);
// The route will be generated like this during the table instantiation:
route('user.edit', [$user, 'foo' => 'bar']);
// Instead of this way:
route('user.edit', [$user->id, 'foo' => 'bar']);
```

## [1.2.2](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/compare/1.2.1...1.2.2)

2019-09-13

* Fixed params order when generating the table routes. The table model id was not positioned at first when declaring other parameters
```php
// With a route declared like this:
Route::get('user/edit/{user}/{foo}', 'UsersController@edit')->name('user.edit');
// And a table routes declaration like this:
(new Table())->model(User::class)->routes([
    // ...
    'edit'    => ['name'=> 'user.edit', 'params' => ['bar']],
    //...
]);
// The route is now correctly generated and gives: /user/edit/1/bar instead of /user/edit/bar/1
```

## [1.2.1](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-table/compare/1.2.0...1.2.1)

2019-09-13

* Fixed the `show`, `edit` and `destroy` route generation, since Laravel 6 does handle differently the key given in the `route()` helper:
```php
// Assuming your declared your edit route like this:
(new Table())->model(User::class)->routes([
    // ...
    'edit'    => ['name'=> 'user.edit', 'params' => ['foo' => 'bar']],
    //...
]);
// The route will be generated like this during the table instantiation:
route('user.edit', [$user->id, 'foo' => 'bar']);
// Instead of this way
route('user.edit', ['id' => $user->id, 'foo' => 'bar']);
```

* Added the possibility to add an identifier to a table with `->identifier('your identifier')`. This identifier will be used for several things:
  * It will be added as an id (formatted as a slug string) to the table itself
  * It will be used to automatically customize the following interaction fields sent to the table, in order to be able to interact with a specific table if you have several of them on a single view: `rows`, `search`, `sort_by`, `sort_dir`
